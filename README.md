# mesh.nav

People get lost. We find them their way.

## Description

A hyperlocal navigation webapp designed for pedestrians.

## How to run

To use mesh.nav, simply visit [our deployment](https://meshnav-frontend.vercel.app/) in your web browser. Please note that our web app utilizes sensitive scopes to provide accurate navigation information, so it requires a secure HTTPS connection.

If you prefer to deploy mesh.nav on your own platform, you can do so using Vercel or any other hosting service that supports HTTPS. Just follow the instructions in our repository to set up the backend and frontend components, ensuring that all sensitive scopes are properly configured for secure operation.
